Database discipline 2 work involving data mining, data analysis and plotting in graphs

Language used in the slide and text document: PT/BR

The job consists of mining data from a dataset, my work was chosen a public dataset, related to data from a school, from the math class (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Student+ Performance), I obtained this data in a .csv file (student-mat.csv).

From this I created a python program called "Estudentes_Insert.py" responsible for reading this data from the .csv file and adding it to the MySQL database, for this purpose a python library called mysql.connector was used.

After that, with another script of mine, "Students_Select.py" I read from the same MySQL database, using the same library mentioned above, did some statistical calculations using the dictionary data structure, added these in a dictionary that includes all these called " arguments "and the result was plotted using the matplotlib library, in the" BD graphics "folder.

The text document "Explanation.txt" is a complementary explanation to all of this.
